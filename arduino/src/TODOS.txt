done
* add fft
* add amplifier control
* add gain control (1, fake 4, 8, 16, 32)
* remove all about changing ref voltage measurement is super noisy
* add frequency, vpp, vmin and vmax, and vavr
* make each channel independant
* separate controls into many files
* put isOversamplingState handling inside a function
* make smoothing factor a slider
* Do the buffer alignment in the board
* add measure ∂t and ∂v

todo
* Find another way to synchronise packets (e.g. better than end of message or prelude)
* get rid of "trashed samples"
* use delta T per sample instead of adc clock ticks per sample
* make axis in react without plot.d3.ts
    - <g ref={node=>select(node).call(axisLeft(y).ticks(10,'%'))}/>
    - or just really make it manually with d3.ticks
* separate analog and digital inputs in different pannels
* add slow mode by frame 1 reading at a time and accumulating in client
* add zoom
* add x y mode
* drag the zero for each plot
* 1 add "zero" function
* store configs and send on start
* final clean up
* publish
* add stm32 support
